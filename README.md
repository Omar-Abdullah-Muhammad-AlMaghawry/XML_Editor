# XML Editor project

## Introduction:
This was a course project for CSE323 (Programming with Data Structures). It aims at creating a program that streamlines the creation and handling of XML files and their conversion into JSON.
It provides error checking, formatting and minfication, and file compression and decompression.

## Program capabilities:

### Viewing and editing XML files:
This program can view and edit XML in a way that streamlines development and writing of XML files.
This applies to existing files or beginning from scratch.

### Error checking:
This program provides error checking on XML codes and provides the location of the line causing the error.
It also prevents operations on an XML file containing errors.

### Formatting:
This program helps you format XML in the most conventional and readable way to be able to browse the information in good manner.

### Minification:
This program helps reduce file size by eliminating unnecessary whitespace (while preserving the integrity of the data) to reduce file size.

### Compression and Decompression:
For further reduction to the file size, the program uses the LZW algorithm to compress and decompress the files for up to 50% and even less compression ratios.

### Conversion to JSON:
This program can also convert any syntactically correct XML file into a JSON file and save it.

## Used technologies:
- C# 9.0
- .NET 3.1

## Launch
There are two ways to launch the program:
1. You can open the project source using Microsoft Visual Studio and running the debugger.
2. You can download the executable file (windows) from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gw0K39e2PBC4Q2vQIc9t40fdL3Vf8QUt?usp=sharing
