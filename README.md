# XML Editor project

## Introduction:
This was a course project for CSE323 (Programming with Data Structures). It aims at creating a program that streamlines the creation and handling of XML files and their conversion into JSON.
It provides error checking, formatting and minfication, and file compression and decompression.

## Program capabilities:

### Viewing and editing XML files:
This program can view and edit XML in a way that streamlines development and writing of XML files.

### Error checking:
This program provides error checking on XML codes and provides the location of the line causing the error.

### Formatting:
This program helps you format XML in the most conventional and readable way to be able to browse the information in good manner.

### Minification:
This program helps reduce file size by eliminating unnecessary whitespace (while preserving the integrity of the data) to reduce file size.

### Compression and decompression:
For further reduction to the file size, the program uses the LZW algorithm to compress and decompress the files for up to 50% and even less compression ratios.

### Conversion to JSON:
This program can also convert any syntactically correct XML file into a JSON file and save it.

## Used technologies:
- C#
- .NET 3.1
